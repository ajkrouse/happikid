I’m designing the full homepage for HappiKid — a B2B2C childcare, enrichment, and youth programs marketplace built on a proprietary childcare decision engine. Please redesign the homepage using UI/UX inspiration from:

- Thumbtack.com  
- HiSawyer.com  
- Winnie.com  
- Wondrfly.com  
- Bumo.com  
- TheKnot.com  
- Zocdoc.com  

BUT with a distinct visual identity built around warmth, trust, approachability, and high design maturity.

========================================================
VISUAL DIRECTION: DISTINCT FROM CARE, WINNIE, SAWYER
========================================================
Use a differentiated palette and textures:

COLOR PALETTE
- Muted earth tones: soft terracotta, sage green, dusty mustard
- Warm neutrals: ivory, cream, warm grey
- Modern accents: deep coral, amber, teal-blue
- Soft gradients: peach→coral, olive→mint, warm sand→taupe

DESIGN ELEMENTS TO INCORPORATE
- Subtle tactile textures (paper, linen, soft grain)
- Organic hand-drawn illustrations or line art
- Light, soft shadows and layered cards
- Rounded but refined corners (not childish)
- Asymmetrical layouts for modern flow
- Humanist sans-serif or warm serif typography
- Gentle micro-animations (hover lifts, fades, color shifts)

OVERALL VIBE
- Warm like Bumo
- Trustworthy like Zocdoc
- Marketplace clarity like Thumbtack
- Playful sophistication like The Knot
- Discovery-first like Sawyer + Wondrfly
