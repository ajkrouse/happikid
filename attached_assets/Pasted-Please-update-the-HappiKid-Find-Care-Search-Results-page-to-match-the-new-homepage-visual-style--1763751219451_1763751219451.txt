Please update the HappiKid “Find Care / Search Results” page to match the new homepage visual style and UX:

• Hybrid style: warm, family-friendly + clean marketplace
• Colors: warm coral/peach, sage/mint, sand/ivory, very soft blues (NOT the older bright blue palette)
• Typography: same serif headlines + sans-serif body as homepage
• Components: rounded cards, soft shadows, pill buttons, pastel icons
• Priority: Parents first, providers second, investors third

Keep the existing overall layout (top search area, filters on the left, results on the right), but update the copy, colors, and hierarchy as described below.

=====================================================
1) PAGE BACKGROUND & GLOBAL STYLE
=====================================================
• Replace the current bright blue accents with the homepage palette:
  - CTAs: warm coral/terracotta
  - Highlights: soft peach, mint, sage
  - Backgrounds: warm ivory / light beige
• Use soft shadows and rounded corners on all cards and filter panels.
• Use the same heading and body fonts as the new homepage.

=====================================================
2) MAIN NATURAL LANGUAGE SEARCH BAR (TOP)
=====================================================
Keep the single large input at the top, but update styling and copy:

• Background: warm ivory with a very light gradient tint (subtle).
• Shape: pill-shaped with soft shadow.
• Left icon: ✨ or 🔍 inside a subtle circle.
• Placeholder text:
  Try: "Montessori programs in Jersey City" or "after-school for 6-year-olds"
• Button on the right:
  - Label: Search
  - Style: solid coral button with white text, rounded, soft hover state.

=====================================================
3) NATURAL LANGUAGE SUGGESTIONS BOX (OPTION B)
=====================================================
Directly under the main input, keep a single rounded box for Natural Language Search suggestions. Medium height (not too tall).

Box styling:
• Background: very light teal/green gradient similar to the hero’s soft gradients.
• Border-radius: 16–20px
• Padding: medium vertical and horizontal
• Soft drop shadow

Inside the box:

Header:
• Title: Try Natural Language Search
• Subtitle/body:
  Just ask naturally. Our AI understands location, age, schedule, teaching style, and more.

Below the header, show 6 suggestion pills in two rows of three, each as a rounded card with a subtle border, small icon, and a category tag.

Suggestion 1:
  Text: "Montessori programs in Jersey City"
  Tag: Educational Philosophy

Suggestion 2:
  Text: "After-school programs near Brooklyn Heights"
  Tag: Location + Type

Suggestion 3:
  Text: "Daycare for 2-year-old twins"
  Tag: Age-Specific

Suggestion 4:
  Text: "Full-time preschool with extended hours"
  Tag: Schedule

Suggestion 5:
  Text: "Affordable summer camps in Queens"
  Tag: Budget

Suggestion 6:
  Text: "Bilingual daycare with outdoor playground"
  Tag: Features

At the bottom of the box, in smaller text:
  Pro tip: Be specific about age and location for the best results. Try “for my 4-year-old” or “in downtown Hoboken.”

=====================================================
4) RESULTS OVERVIEW BAR (ABOVE GRID)
=====================================================
Immediately above the results grid/list, add a horizontal bar that summarizes the results and controls:

Left side:
• Text: 630 childcare options found
  (Use dynamic number styling; this is just example copy.)

Right side:
• Button: My Groups (icon + text)
• Sort dropdown:
  - Label: Best Match (default)
  - Options:
    • Best Match
    • Highest Rated
    • Most Popular
    • Newest Listings
    • Price: Low to High
    • Price: High to Low
• View toggle icons for:
  - Grid view (default)
  - List view
  - Map view

All of these should use the warm palette, with active states highlighted in coral or sage.

=====================================================
5) TRUST SIGNAL STRIP (UNDER RESULTS HEADER)
=====================================================
Under the results overview bar, add a light, subtle trust strip in a very soft mint or ivory background:

Content (inline with small icons):
• ✓ Verified through public records
• ✓ Real parent reviews
• ✓ Updated for 2025
• ✓ Personalized matching

Use small checked icons and muted colors so it’s visible but not heavy.

=====================================================

=====================================================
SUMMARY
=====================================================
Overall, please:
• Remove the old bright-blue heavy style and align this page with the new warm, modern homepage.
• Keep layout responsive: one-column cards on mobile, two or three columns on desktop.
• Make Natural Language Search feel like the primary way to start, with filters as a powerful secondary refinement.
• Ensure all text above is used or closely paraphrased for clarity and emotional resonance with parents.

Apply these changes to the current “Find Care / Search Results” page.
