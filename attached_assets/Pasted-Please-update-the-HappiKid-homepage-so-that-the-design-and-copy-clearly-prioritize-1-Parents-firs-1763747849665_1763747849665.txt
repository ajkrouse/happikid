Please update the HappiKid homepage so that the design and copy clearly prioritize:

1) Parents first (clarity, warmth, confidence, ease)
2) Providers second (growth, visibility, simplicity)
3) Investors third (subtle sophistication through structure and polish)

Make the visual style warm, modern, trustworthy, and parent-friendly, using brighter accents (coral, teal, amber) to balance the earthy neutrals.

Below is the updated copy for every section. Please replace the existing text with this cleaner and more emotionally resonant version.

### VISUAL / STRUCTURAL INSTRUCTIONS

1. Parent-first tone throughout: warm, supportive, clear, human.
2. Increase contrast and brightness in accent colors so it feels slightly more joyful for families.
3. Keep the earthy neutrals, but lighten the beige backgrounds for better readability.
4. Standardize the logo and CTA style globally.
5. Maintain clear spacing and strong visual hierarchy.
6. Ensure CTAs are consistently labeled across navbar, hero, and footer.

Apply all changes above while preserving the existing layout structure.
