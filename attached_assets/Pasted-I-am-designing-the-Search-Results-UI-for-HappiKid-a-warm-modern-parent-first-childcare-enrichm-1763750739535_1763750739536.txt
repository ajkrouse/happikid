I am designing the Search Results UI for HappiKid — a warm, modern, parent-first childcare + enrichment marketplace. Please generate a full, production-quality Search Results page using HTML + CSS (no frameworks), with a style consistent with the HappiKid homepage:

• warm earth-tone palette (coral, peach, sage, mint, sand, ivory)
• soft rounded cards
• light tactile shadows
• friendly pastel iconography
• serif headlines + clean sans-serif body text
• modern marketplace patterns (Thumbtack + Zocdoc clarity)
• discovery-focused layout (Sawyer + Wondrfly inspiration)
• trust-first visual style (parents first, providers second)

This page should feel clean, trustworthy, warm, and easy to scan.

=====================================================
OVERALL PURPOSE
=====================================================
Parents should immediately understand:

• What programs match their needs  
• Why these programs are shown  
• What filters they can adjust  
• Which results are verified or top-rated  
• How to compare options quickly  
• How to view details or save programs

Secondary: Providers should feel that listing with HappiKid results in a clean, professional marketplace presence.

=====================================================
PAGE STRUCTURE (HIGH-LEVEL)
=====================================================
1. Compact top bar summary  
2. Filters (mobile collapsible)  
3. Sort dropdown  
4. AI “Best Matches” ribbon (optional but recommended)  
5. Program cards grid/list  
6. Pagination or infinite scroll  
7. Empty state design  
8. Bottom CTA strip

Design MUST be mobile-first, then scale beautifully to desktop.

=====================================================
1) TOP SUMMARY BAR
=====================================================
A soft ivory or warm beige bar summarizing the search:

• Location: “Jersey City, NJ”  
• Category: “Daycare · After-School · Activities”  
• Results count: “127 programs found”

On mobile: stack them.  
On desktop: inline with separators (soft sage or clay line).

Typography: serif headline style for the numbers, sans-serif for labels.

=====================================================
2) FILTERS PANEL

=====================================================
4) AI “BEST MATCHES FOR YOU” STRIP

A narrow coral- or peach-tinted ribbon above the first few results:

Left side:
“✨ HappiKid’s best matches for your criteria”

Small pill button:  
“Why these results?”

Below the ribbon, show 2–3 horizontal “reason cards”:

=====================================================
5) PROGRAM RESULTS GRID/LIST
=====================================================
On mobile: one card per row.  
On desktop: two or three cards per row.

Each card should be a warm, soft, friendly container:

CARD STRUCTURE:

TRUST
• Star rating + reviews  
• Safety/verification badges

• Tags for program features (e.g., “STEM”, “Outdoor play”, “Montessori”)

=====================================================

=====================================================
7) EMPTY STATE
=====================================================
If no results match filters:

Illustration: simple hand-drawn line art (nest, magnifying glass, or map pin)

Headline:
“No exact matches yet”

Subtext:
“Try adjusting age, schedule, or distance — or explore nearby neighborhoods.”

Button:
Reset Filters

=====================================================
8) BOTTOM CTA STRIP
=====================================================
Warm peach or coral gradient strip:

Button:
Create a free account →

=====================================================
VISUAL & TYPOGRAPHIC GUIDANCE
=====================================================
• Use the same serif headline + sans-serif body font pairing as homepage.  
• Use soft corals, sage greens, dusty mint, warm peach, and ivory backgrounds.  
• Keep everything warm, clean, and modern — no harsh edges or neon colors.  
• Use very soft shadows and pastel iconography to match the brand’s emotional tone.  
• Maintain high readability: clear spacing, comfortable line height, generous padding.  
• Buttons and chips should feel tactile and friendly, not flat or corporate.  
• The whole page must feel consistent with the homepage (style, palette, typography).

Please now generate the complete HTML + CSS for this Search Results page, following the visual system of the existing HappiKid homepage.
