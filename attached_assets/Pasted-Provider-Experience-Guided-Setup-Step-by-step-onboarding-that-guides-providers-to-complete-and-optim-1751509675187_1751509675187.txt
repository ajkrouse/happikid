Provider Experience
Guided Setup
Step-by-step onboarding that guides providers to complete and optimize their profiles (including basic info, service category, availability, pricing, licensing/accreditation, program highlights, unique selling points, media/photos, FAQs, and contact details).
Tips/tooltips for each step that explain why a field matters (e.g., 'Photos increase parent engagement by 20%').
Progress tracker (completeness %), with locked profile visibility until critical info is added.
Callout for verification—trusted badge, licensing check, and how to submit documents.
Embedded prompts to help providers write compelling descriptions (AI suggestions for uniqueness, approachable tone, etc).
Recommendations for Visibility
On dashboard and during setup, providers receive a prioritized checklist ('Get Found More!') tailored to their profile and market, e.g.:
Add another program/age range
Upload more photos
Respond to most-asked FAQs
Complete licensing for badge
Gather first reviews
Explain algorithmically how these actions help boost search and comparison rank.
Smart notification banner or side-panel with actionable advice.
Recommendations engine adapts in real-time as competition or parent demand changes (market fit prompts).
Surface leaderboard or “top providers near you” for extra motivation (optional, premium).
Insights Dashboard
STANDARD (basic, free) dashboard features:
Views, profile clicks, and inquiry counts (by day/week/month)
Top comparison criteria that parents searched for vs. how your profile performs
Common missed opportunities (e.g., '20 parents filtered for after-6pm pickup')
Profile completeness and checklist reminders
PREMIUM dashboard features:
Competitive benchmarking (see how you stack up on price, schedule, ratings vs. local peers)
Visibility insights: Ranking in searches, comparison adds, favorites, and parent engagement patterns
Conversion tracking (inquiries → bookings)
Parent review and sentiment analytics (highlights from open-text reviews or Q&A)
Advanced notifications: Market alerts (e.g. 'Rising demand for STEM camps in your zip'), trending FAQs, target customer fit probes.
Clear upsell CTA to upgrade for premium insights—a locked banner with “Unlock full insights” prompt.
Integrate all these details into the Requirements/Provider section of the doc, making it clear which features are basic (in MVP) and which are premium (post-MVP/paid upgrade). Use bullet points or formatting to make these distinctions explicit.
