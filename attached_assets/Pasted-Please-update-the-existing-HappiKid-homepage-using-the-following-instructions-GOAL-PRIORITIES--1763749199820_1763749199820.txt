Please update the existing HappiKid homepage using the following instructions.

GOAL & PRIORITIES
-----------------
• Hybrid visual style: warm, family-friendly (Sawyer/Winnie/The Knot) + clean, modern marketplace (Thumbtack/Zocdoc).
• Clear priority:
  1) Parents first (clarity, warmth, confidence, ease)
  2) Providers second (growth, visibility, simplicity)
  3) Investors third (they infer quality from polish and UX)
• Keep the current warm earth-tone palette and gradients, but ensure good contrast and a slightly brighter, optimistic feel.

SECTION ORDER
-------------
Use this general section order (you can keep existing layout blocks but adjust their order to match this narrative as closely as possible):

1. Hero (promise + search)
2. Trust strip (3 icons)
3. Problem: “Childcare search is broken”
4. Journey: “Families move across categories…”
5. Category grid (care types)
6. Featured / Top-rated providers
7. Social proof stats + testimonials
8. AI decision engine
9. Provider growth OS
10. Why Now
11. Final CTA band
12. Footer

VISUAL / UX TWEAKS
-------------------
• Maintain the warm, earthy palette but slightly increase contrast for body text on colored backgrounds.
• Use accent colors (coral, amber, teal) on buttons, chips, and key highlights to add energy.
• Ensure consistent CTA labels across navbar, hero, and sections:
  - “Find Programs” for parents
  - “List Your Program” for providers
• Keep section spacing generous and headers clearly distinct so the page feels long but easy to skim.
• Preserve the current typography choices (serif headings + sans-serif body) and rounded cards.

Please apply all copy and structural changes above, while keeping the core visual style and overall layout consistent with the existing design.
